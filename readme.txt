FX-ForeignExchange 6 currency cross table plugin for Wordpress. This easy to use tool adds a horizontal 6 currency table to posts and pages, and the widget adds a 3 column portrait table to sidebars. The 6 currencies can be selected by the user from a list of 3 over 180 worldwide. The rates are based on a 12 minute delay feed and are live ECB interbank rates. An ideal tool for forex, currency trading and commodities sites and a very attractive addition to any e-commerce site where buyers are likely to originate across more than one currency zone.
